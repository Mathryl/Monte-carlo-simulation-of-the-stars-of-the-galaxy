# Monte-carlo-simulation-of-the-stars-of-the-galaxy
This code simulates a population of stars based on the Kroupa IMF, using the Monte Carlo method, and categorizes them into different stages of stellar evolution, such as the main sequence, white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. It then visualizes the mass and age distributions of these stars and calculates the fractions of stars in each category.
Although i didn't have the time to make a full paper as requested, i want to have a little discussion about the project and the results.

This method for creating random numbers and using that for simulating stars in a galaxy was both interesting and also very useful, since the results actually reflected the real-life data that we have. It's not the easiest way of making simulations but all things considered it wasn't the worst either.
I do want to say that the instructions were not as clear as i would've liked but the overall idea of this work was nice since it took plenty of our knowledge that we've accumulated on this career and used it to make our own simulation of a galaxy.


Again i do have to say that i'm sorry for not making the paper and i fully embrace the grade that i'll receive.
