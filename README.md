# Monte-carlo-simulation-of-the-stars-of-the-galaxy
#This code simulates a population of stars based on the Kroupa IMF, using the Monte Carlo method, and categorizes them into different stages of stellar evolution, such as the main sequence, white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. It then visualizes the mass and age distributions of these stars and calculates the fractions of stars in each category.
